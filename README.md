###Bugs
There are no known bugs, insofar as I can tell.

###It should state whether you’ve attempted just the basic requirement or if you’ve attempted the augmented portion -- if so, what cases does your program handle?
I've covered the basic requirements, and added a few augmentations of my own: ordinals, abbreviations, times, ratios, roman numerals, and distances.

###Disclaimer
The code for numeral_to_int( ) was inspired by [this](http://www.docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils/utils/roman.py) piece of code.
