#What was your strategy for identifying variations, given that you probably donâ€™t want to read every sentence? 
In order to best be able to cover all of the numerous cases, I designed my code such that it worked in layers. Each line of input is passed through multiple functions which check for the presence of certain cases (e.g. dates, money, numbers), and then provide the correct English equivalent. Each layer or filter of my algorithm builds off of the previous one, such that it can gracefully handle combinations of cases, even those that haven't yet been seen.  

#Were there difficult cases that your program cannot correctly handle using regular expression matching?  If so, what additional tools do you think might be needed? 
There were a few cases that I found where my algorithm did not adept itself easily to solving them. These cases would not be hard to implement per say, but in order to avoid bloating my logic I tended away from fixing every little idiosyncrasy I could find. In order to more effectively capture all the edge cases without bloating logic, it would probably become necessary to employ some degree of machine learning to capture the more complex patterns of the English language.
